# DarwinCMS System Architecture

## üìå Purpose

DarwinCMS is built as both a real-world content management system and an educational tool for developers at all levels. The architecture aims to:

- Demonstrate best practices in modern .NET application design
- Serve real business needs while staying developer-friendly
- Support modular growth, domain separation, testability, and maintainability
- Provide a transition path to microservices and the cloud (Azure)

---

## üß± Architectural Overview

DarwinCMS uses **Clean Architecture** as the foundation, extended with:

- **Modular Monolith Design** ‚Äì Independent bounded contexts via feature folders and modules
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** ‚Äì Entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services
- **Event-Driven Design** ‚Äì Using domain events and mediator patterns
- **Dependency Inversion** ‚Äì Abstractions in core, implementations in outer layers
- **Scalable & Testable Design** ‚Äì Supports unit, integration, and acceptance testing

## üß© Layers in Detail

### 1. Domain Layer

- Contains only business logic, no external dependencies.
- Defines core rules, constraints, and the "heart" of the application.
- Includes:
  - Entities
  - Value Objects
  - Domain Events
  - Repository Interfaces

### 2. Application Layer

- Contains CQRS commands/queries and business use cases.
- Coordinates between domain logic and infrastructure implementations.
- Includes:
  - Application Services
  - DTOs and Mappers
  - Validators (FluentValidation)
  - MediatR Handlers
  - Interfaces to infrastructure services

### 3. Infrastructure Layer

- Implements everything external to the application logic.
- Includes:
  - EF Core and Identity
  - File Storage
  - Email Sender
  - External APIs (e.g., SharePoint, CRM)
  - Configuration and startup wiring

### 4. Presentation Layer (Web)

- ASP.NET Core project using Razor Pages and Telerik UI
- Handles UI, routing, controllers (optional), layout, and user interaction
- Integrates authentication and global error handling

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Patterns and Practices

- **MediatR** for CQRS and event handling
- **FluentValidation** for input validation
- **AutoMapper** (optional) for object transformation
- **EF Core** with Fluent API for database mapping
- **Modular Folder Structure** per module
- **Event Bus** for internal decoupled communication
- **Partial Views / ViewComponents** for reusable UI
- **Middleware for Exception Handling, Logging, Localization**

---

## üß† Design Principles

- **Open/Closed Principle** ‚Äì Easily extend modules with minimal change
- **Single Responsibility** ‚Äì Every layer/module has one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns** ‚Äì Each concern handled in the correct layer
- **Testability** ‚Äì Core logic is mockable and testable without web/db

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Future-Ready

The system is prepared for:

- Docker-based deployment
- Azure App Services, AKS, or Kubernetes
- Cloud Identity providers (Azure AD, Google, etc.)
- Event Grid for domain events (planned)
- Azure Monitor / Application Insights
- Office 365 API integration

---

## üîÑ Diagram Reference

DarwinCMS includes diagrams for:

- Full layered architecture
- Event Bus interaction between modules
- Deployment topologies (shared hosting vs. cloud-native)
- API Gateway and future service mesh integration

These are included in `/docs/images/` and referenced in the GitHub Wiki or exported documentation.

## üéì Educational Focus

This project supports a full educational video course. The course starts from basics (HTML, C#, Razor) and evolves toward:

- SOLID + Clean Architecture
- Modular CMS development
- Office 365 and Graph API integration
- Identity + Security + Multi-tenancy (optional)
- Event-driven + cloud-native patterns

The goal: learners should be able to build a similar CMS from scratch by the end.
